                    <h3>Persistent</h3>
                    <p>I don't give up easily when facing coding challenges. This helps me debug programs until they work.</p>

                    <h3>Curious</h3>
                    <p>I love learning new technologies. This drives me to explore beyond the classroom material.</p>

                    <h3>Organized</h3>
                    <p>I keep my code and notes well-structured. This helps me manage multiple assignments effectively.</p>

            <h2>My Hero: Racquel McInnis [Sister]</h2>
            <p> <strong>Why:</strong> Despite her own struggles, my sister refuses to let them define who she is.  She treats everyone with kindness, patience, and hard effort.  When I saw her persevere despite challenges, it motivates me to do the same.</p>

            <h2>AI Business Idea Report</h2>
            <p>AI-Powered Tutoring Systems can revolutionize education in Jamaica by providing personalized learning support to students across the island.Teachers usually have to give the "same lesson" to everyone, even though students have different learning styles, strengths, and limitations. An adaptive learning system can be applied by creating  customized exercises for each student based on their needs, learning pace, and preference for visual, auditory, or drill-based activities. It can also dynamically stimulate weak areas. 
            <p><strong>Why it is Useful</strong></p>
            <li>Learning that is more efficient involves focusing on what you need rather than what you already know.</li>
            <li>Seeing development personalized to your needs will increase your confidence.</li>
            <li>Fills in the gaps where certain students can fall behind due to variations in style or pace.</li>
            <p><strong>Ethical Concerns</strong></p>
            <p>These include bias in training data, over-reliance on technology, data privacy (because the system gathers performance data), and unequal access for pupils without devices or internet.  My idea is to assure strong data privacy, fairness audits, and low-cost or offline alternatives to name a few.</p>
            <p><strong>App </strong></p>
            <p>One App to note is W3Schools (w3schools.com
) a well-known online learning platform for web development that now offers Pathfinder and Academy features, which create personalized study plans, give real-time feedback, highlight learning gaps, and allow learners to track progress and adjust pacing to their needs.</p>
